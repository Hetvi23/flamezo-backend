Loyalty Scheduler Tasks

  grant_birthday_bonuses — runs daily at 08:00 IST
    Finds customers whose birthday is today (month+day match), verifies they
    have order history at the restaurant, and credits birthday_bonus_coins.
    Idempotent: skips customers who already received a Birthday Bonus entry
    for the current calendar year at that restaurant.

  send_coin_expiry_notifications — runs daily at 10:00 IST
    Finds customers with settled, non-expired Earn coins expiring within 7 days.
    Sends a single push notification per customer (deduplicated via frappe.cache).
    Idempotent: a customer who already got a nudge today is skipped.

  reset_referral_cycles_monthly — runs on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC
    Resets rewarded_opens_in_cycle = 0 for ALL referral links globally.
