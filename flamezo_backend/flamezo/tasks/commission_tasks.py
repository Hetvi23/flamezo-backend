"""
Flamezo Commission Engine — Scheduled Tasks
============================================

Three cadences:

  • Daily   — `retry_wallet_settlements` sweeps outstanding ledger entries
              that wallet balance now covers (e.g. restaurant topped up
              after a busy cash day).
  • Weekly  — `weekly_autopay_sweep` is Tier 2: triggers a Razorpay
              mandate charge for any restaurant whose outstanding balance
              exceeds the minimum sweep floor (₹50).
  • Daily   — `clear_expired_throttles` unsets `cash_payments_disabled_until`
              when the cooldown window has passed.

Each task is idempotent and individually scoped — a failure on one
restaurant never blocks the next. All errors are logged via
`frappe.log_error` for ops review.
