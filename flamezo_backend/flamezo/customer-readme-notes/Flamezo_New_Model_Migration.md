# Flamezo — Current Business Model & Backend Reference

> **Last Updated:** 2026-05-23 | **Status:** Live (Razorpay Route migration complete)
>
> This document was originally written as a migration plan from the older B2B SaaS model to the current two-sided platform model. The migration is now complete. This file is preserved as the **single-source-of-truth reference** for the current model, with the historical "old model" section kept for context only.

## 1. CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL

### Overview
Flamezo operates as a **two-sided restaurant platform**:
- **Free onboarding** — restaurants get the full feature suite immediately on signup. No unlock fee, no prepayment, no trial timer.
- Flamezo sits in the payment flow and collects a **Success Share** on every order.
- Flamezo brings new customers to restaurants via the FLAMEZO consumer app and cross-restaurant loyalty.

### Core Principle
> "We grow when restaurants grow. We earn when they earn."

### Onboarding Terms

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Onboarding Fee** | ₹0 |
| **Prepayment** | ₹0 |
| **Feature Access** | Full suite from day 1 — ordering, loyalty, marketing, POS, AI, analytics |
| **Trial Period** | None — free onboarding is permanent; there is no trial timer |
| **Tier Paywall** | None — all features unlocked from day 1 for every new restaurant |

> **Note on legacy tiers:** The names `SILVER` and `GOLD` may still appear in internal code (`plan_type` field, doctype enums) and in legacy/grandfathered restaurant accounts onboarded under the previous model. For all new restaurants signed up under the current model, the tier distinction is effectively dead — every restaurant gets the full GOLD-equivalent feature set immediately.

## 2. REVENUE STREAMS

### Primary Revenue — Success Share

| Stream | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Success Share (new restaurants)** | **3% of every order GMV** | Deducted via Razorpay Route auto-split on online orders; tracked in commission ledger for cash orders |
| **Success Share (legacy/grandfathered)** | **1.5% of every order GMV** | For restaurants onboarded before the May 2026 migration who chose to stay on legacy terms |
| **Monthly Floor** | **₹199/month** | Backstop that kicks in if a restaurant's Success Share for the month is below ₹199; only the shortfall is charged |
| **GST on Success Share** | **18%** | Applied on the Success Share amount, per Indian tax regulations |

### Secondary Revenue (Usage-Based)

| Stream | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp messages | ₹1.20/msg | Margin ₹0.43/msg |
| SMS | ₹0.25/msg | Margin ₹0.07/msg |
| Email | ₹0.05/msg | High margin |
| Delivery handling | ₹5/order | Via Borzo/Flash |
| AI dish generation | ₹10/image | Per-use |
| AI image enhancement | ₹5/image | Per-use |
| Lead unlock | ₹1/lead (>24h) | Customer data access |
| Wallet recharge bonuses | 10% at ₹2,999+ / 20% at ₹4,999+ | Drives pre-paid float |
| Referral | ₹500 both parties (on ₹1,000 recharge) | Acquisition |

## 3. PAYMENT FLOW (RAZORPAY ROUTE)

The current architecture uses **Razorpay Route** for true real-time split on online orders, with a commission ledger waterfall for cash orders.

### Online Orders — Auto-Split via Razorpay Route

```
Consumer places order
       ↓
Razorpay collects full payment
       ↓
Razorpay Route auto-splits at the moment of payment:
       ├── 97% → Restaurant's Linked Account (lands in bank T+2 business days)
       └── 3%  → Flamezo (Success Share — 1.5% for legacy restaurants)
       ↓
Gateway 2% goes to Razorpay — passed through to consumer/restaurant
```

Restaurants complete a one-time Razorpay Route KYC (see `Flamezo_Direct_Bank_Payouts_Guide.md`) to activate direct payouts. Until that KYC is complete, payments fall back to Flamezo's holding account and are settled weekly via NEFT.

### Cash Orders — Commission Ledger with 4-Tier Waterfall

For cash orders, 100% of the cash stays at the counter with the restaurant. The Success Share accrues to a commission ledger and is recovered via a 4-tier waterfall:

1. **Wallet** — deducted from the restaurant's Flamezo wallet first
2. **Online net-off** — netted off against the next online order's split (we take a bit extra from the next online split until cleared)
3. **Autopay sweep** — debited via the restaurant's UPI/card mandate
4. **Throttle** — if all above fail, certain growth features are temporarily paused until the ledger is cleared

This way, restaurants never receive a manual invoice for cash Success Share — it's recovered automatically in the background.

## 6. PHASE 2 REVENUE STREAMS (ROADMAP)

These are designed but not yet live. Doctype schemas exist where useful to avoid painful migrations later.

#### FLAMEZO Pass (Consumer Subscription)
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | ₹99/month consumer subscription — 2x loyalty coins + free weekly delivery |
| Doctype | `FLAMEZO Pass Subscription` (customer, start_date, end_date, status, razorpay_subscription_id) |
| Logic | On order: check if customer has active Pass → apply 2x coin multiplier |
| Revenue | 5,000 subscribers × ₹99 = ₹4.95L/month pure margin |

#### Featured Restaurant Placement
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | Restaurants pay ₹500–2,000/month to appear at top of discovery in their city |
| Doctype | `FLAMEZO Featured Slot` (restaurant, city, amount, valid_from, valid_until, is_active) |
| Logic | `get_all_restaurants()` → sort featured restaurants first, then by distance |
| Revenue | 50 restaurants × ₹1,000/month = ₹50,000/month |

#### Peak-Hour Convenience Fee
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | ₹10–15 flat fee on orders placed Fri/Sat 7–10 PM |
| Logic | In `create_payment_order()` — check day + time → add convenience_fee |
| Field | `convenience_fee` on Order doctype |
| Revenue | 500 orders/day × ₹10 × 8 peak hours/week = ₹40,000/month |

#### Event/Ticket Commission
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | Restaurants list events; consumers buy tickets through Flamezo |
| Take rate | 8–10% commission |

#### Table Reservation Fee
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | Consumer pays ₹20–30/booking; split with restaurant |

## 7. HISTORICAL: OLD MODEL (PRE-MAY 2026)

> Kept for context. **None of the items in this section apply to new restaurants under the current model.**

### Old Tier Structure (Retired)

| Tier | Cost | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **SILVER** | ₹0/month | QR menu only. No online payments. No dine-in ordering. |
| **GOLD** | ₹1,299 one-time unlock + ₹399/month floor + 1.5% commission | Full suite: ordering, loyalty, marketing, POS, AI, analytics |

### Old Gold Floor Model (Retired)
- 1.5% commission deducted from every order
- ₹399/month minimum guaranteed
- ₹1,299 one-time GOLD unlock fee
- All three of the above have been retired. Current model: **3% Success Share, ₹199/month floor, ₹0 onboarding fee** for all new restaurants.

### Why the Migration Happened
1. **₹1,299 unlock barrier** caused restaurants to churn before seeing value
2. **No consumer play** — purely B2B, no reason for diners to use Flamezo over Zomato
3. **No network effect** — 100 restaurants didn't make it easier to land restaurant #101
4. **Revenue ceiling** — SaaS multiples are 5–8x; platform multiples are 20–50x
5. **Single acquisition channel** — 100% dependent on Meta Ads

### What Changed in the Migration
- **₹1,299 unlock fee → removed.** Every restaurant onboards free.
- **Tier paywall (SILVER vs GOLD) → removed for new restaurants.** All features open day 1.
- **90-day trial concept → discarded.** Original plan included a 90-day free window before the floor kicked in; in the final model, free onboarding is permanent (no trial timer at all), and the ₹199 floor only triggers when monthly Success Share falls below it.
- **1.5% commission → 3% Success Share** for new restaurants (1.5% grandfathered for legacy).
- **₹399/month floor → ₹199/month floor.**
- **Monthly mandate billing → Razorpay Route auto-split** for online orders (real-time, T+2 settlement to restaurant's bank).
- **Customer-facing copy:** "commission" → "Success Share" (internal code identifiers like `commission_amount` are unchanged).

### Legacy Restaurant Treatment
Restaurants onboarded under the old model retain their **1.5% commission rate** as a grandfather clause if they were active before the May 2026 cutover. They may also still have their old `plan_type` value (`SILVER` or `GOLD`) in the database. Migration to the new ₹199 floor was offered as an opt-in.
