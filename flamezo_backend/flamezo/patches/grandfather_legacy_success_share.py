Grandfather Legacy Restaurants at 1.5% Success Share
====================================================

Context: in May 2026 we raised the default Success Share from 1.5% to 3.0%
for *new* restaurants. Existing restaurants must keep their old rate (or
they'd silently see a 2x charge on their next bill).

This patch locks in 1.5% on every Restaurant whose `platform_fee_percent`
is currently NULL or 1.5 (i.e. they were created under the old default).
Restaurants that have been explicitly customised to any other value
(0, 2.0, 5.0, …) are left untouched.

Idempotent: re-running is a no-op once the field is populated.

Run order in patches.txt: must run AFTER `init_commission_engine`
(which creates the column) and AFTER doctype sync (which loads the new
3.0 default for fresh inserts).
