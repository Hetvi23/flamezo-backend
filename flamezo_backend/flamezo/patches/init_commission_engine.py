Init Commission Engine (Razorpay Route Hybrid)
==============================================

One-shot migration to roll out the cash-commission settlement engine:

  1. Backfill `Restaurant.outstanding_commission_paise = 0` for any rows
     where it's NULL after the schema patch.
  2. Default `Restaurant.route_mode` to `flamezo_hold` so the existing
     payment flow stays untouched until per-restaurant KYC is collected.
  3. Default `Order.settlement_mode` to `flamezo_hold` for historical
     orders so analytics queries don't trip on NULLs.

Idempotent — re-running is a no-op once values are in place.
